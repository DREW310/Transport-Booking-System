# Booking Status Fix Summary

## üö® Problem Identified
**Issue**: Bookings were being marked as "Completed" even when their departure times were in the future (e.g., Jul 10, 2025 and Jul 8, 2025).

## üîç Root Cause Analysis
The problem was caused by **timezone inconsistencies** and **improper time comparison logic** in multiple files:

1. **PHP vs MySQL Time Mismatch**: Using PHP's `date()` and `time()` functions alongside MySQL's `NOW()` created timezone conflicts
2. **Immediate Completion Logic**: Bookings were marked as completed the moment departure time passed, without considering actual trip completion
3. **Multiple Inconsistent Time Comparisons**: Different files used different methods for time comparison

## ‚úÖ Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Auto-Completion Logic (`views/bookings.php`)
**Before**:
```php
$now = date('Y-m-d H:i:s');
$stmt = $db->prepare('UPDATE bookings b JOIN schedules s ON b.schedule_id = s.id SET b.status = ? WHERE b.user_id = ? AND s.departure_time <= ? AND b.status NOT IN (?, ?)');
$stmt->execute(['Completed', $user_id, $now, 'Cancelled', 'Completed']);
```

**After**:
```php
$stmt = $db->prepare('UPDATE bookings b 
                     JOIN schedules s ON b.schedule_id = s.id 
                     SET b.status = ? 
                     WHERE b.user_id = ? 
                     AND s.departure_time <= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 HOUR)
                     AND b.status NOT IN (?, ?)');
$stmt->execute(['Completed', $user_id, 'Cancelled', 'Completed']);
```

**Improvements**:
- ‚úÖ Uses MySQL `NOW()` instead of PHP `date()`
- ‚úÖ Added 1-hour safety margin (only marks completed 1 hour after departure)
- ‚úÖ Eliminates timezone conflicts

### 2. Fixed Time Filtering Logic (`views/bookings.php`)
**Before**:
```php
$now = date('Y-m-d H:i:s');
$upcoming = array_filter($bookings, function($b) use ($now) { return $b['departure_time'] > $now && $b['status'] !== 'Cancelled'; });
```

**After**:
```php
$current_time_result = $db->query("SELECT NOW() as current_time")->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
$now = $current_time_result['current_time'];
$upcoming = array_filter($bookings, function($b) use ($now) { 
    return $b['departure_time'] > $now && $b['status'] !== 'Cancelled'; 
});
```

### 3. Fixed Admin Schedule Time Checks (`views/admin_schedules.php`)
**Before**:
```php
$is_past = strtotime($schedule['departure_time']) < time();
$is_soon = strtotime($schedule['departure_time']) < (time() + 3600);
```

**After**:
```php
$current_time_result = $db->query("SELECT NOW() as current_time")->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
$current_time = $current_time_result['current_time'];
$is_past = $schedule['departure_time'] < $current_time;
$is_soon = $schedule['departure_time'] < date('Y-m-d H:i:s', strtotime($current_time) + 3600);
```

### 4. Fixed Admin Booking Time Checks (`views/admin_bookings.php`)
- Updated to use database time instead of PHP time functions
- Consistent time comparison across admin interfaces

### 5. Fixed Schedule Form Validation (`views/admin_schedule_form.php`)
**Before**:
```php
} elseif (strtotime($departure_time) <= time()) {
    $error = 'Departure time must be in the future.';
```

**After**:
```php
$time_check = $db->prepare("SELECT CASE WHEN ? <= NOW() THEN 1 ELSE 0 END as is_past");
$time_check->execute([$departure_time]);
$is_past = $time_check->fetchColumn();

if ($is_past) {
    $error = 'Departure time must be in the future.';
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Diagnostic Tools Created

### 1. `fix_incorrect_completed_bookings.php`
- Identifies bookings incorrectly marked as completed
- Provides one-click fix to revert future bookings back to "Booked" status
- Shows time comparison analysis

### 2. `test_booking_status_fix.php`
- Tests the new auto-completion logic
- Compares old vs new logic results
- Shows booking status distribution

### 3. `debug_booking_status.php`
- Comprehensive debugging of booking status issues
- Timezone analysis
- Time comparison testing

## üìä Key Improvements

### Business Logic Improvements
1. **1-Hour Safety Margin**: Bookings only marked as completed 1 hour after departure
2. **Consistent Time Source**: All time comparisons now use MySQL functions
3. **Timezone Conflict Resolution**: Eliminated PHP/MySQL timezone mismatches

### Technical Improvements
1. **Database-Centric Time Logic**: All time operations use MySQL `NOW()`
2. **Consistent API**: Standardized time comparison across all files
3. **Error Prevention**: Added validation to prevent future scheduling conflicts

## üß™ Testing Instructions

1. **Run Fix Script**:
   ```
   http://localhost/TWT-Transport-Booking-System/fix_incorrect_completed_bookings.php
   ```

2. **Test New Logic**:
   ```
   http://localhost/TWT-Transport-Booking-System/test_booking_status_fix.php
   ```

3. **Debug if Needed**:
   ```
   http://localhost/TWT-Transport-Booking-System/debug_booking_status.php
   ```

## üéØ Expected Results

After applying these fixes:
- ‚úÖ Future bookings (Jul 10, 2025, Jul 8, 2025) should show as "Booked", not "Completed"
- ‚úÖ Only bookings with departures more than 1 hour in the past will be marked as "Completed"
- ‚úÖ All time comparisons will be consistent across the system
- ‚úÖ No more timezone-related booking status issues

## üîÑ Files Modified

1. `views/bookings.php` - Fixed auto-completion and filtering logic
2. `views/admin_schedules.php` - Fixed time comparison for schedule display
3. `views/admin_bookings.php` - Fixed time comparison for booking management
4. `views/admin_schedule_form.php` - Fixed validation time checks

## üìù Next Steps

1. Run the fix script to correct existing incorrect bookings
2. Test the booking page to verify future bookings show as "Booked"
3. Monitor the system to ensure no new incorrect completions occur
4. Consider adding automated tests for time-based logic in the future
